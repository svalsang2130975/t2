<p>HI! I am <strong>Sahana Valsang</strong>, an undergraduate student at <em>Christ University</em>. I am studying<span style="color: #ff0000;"> History, Economics, and Political science</span>.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, I enjoy playing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">chess, traveling to new places, and learning new languages.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like giving opinions on current topics. Below is a writing sample:&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My Writing Samples</h2>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">The study of history is often limited by what actually happened. Fiction, unlike history, has the liberty to escape addressing truth and instead engage in speculation on ahistorical truths. This was the argument Aristotle made in his book Poetics while portraying history as inherently inferior to poetry. Amongst fiction, the genre of fantasy is probably the farthest truth from discourses about the past. However, the author or creator of fictional worlds is to be tainted by the ideologies that stem from the real world. Even though the traditional historian claims to have an established guardianship over history, the overreach of such fictional works over the general population is more massive. This is in context with a series that is arguably as popular as the Bible and Mao&rsquo;s Red Book &ndash; the Harry Potter series.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">JK Rowling is a postmodern author writing a post-modern book in a post-modern world. This particular movie, &ldquo;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,&rdquo; is directed by David Yates for the purpose of a postmodern audience. However, the ideologies in the movie seem to be anti-modern and ethereal. Although the movie parallels the magical world, this world is simply to be seen as a return to medievalist England. The gothic architecture we encounter throughout the movie as opposed to Harry&rsquo;s &ldquo;muggle&rdquo; world which denotes a modern constructed society shows Rowling&rsquo;s belief that magic is running parallelly in safeguarded institutions of the past. This is with reference to the British educational institutions as Hogwarts depicts the British boarding school culture.&nbsp; The movie starts off with the contemporary Surbiton train station and transitions to filming in the Gloucester Cathedral towards the end.</span></p>
